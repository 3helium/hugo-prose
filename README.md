# HUGO STOIC

## _It is not the man who has too little that is poor, but the one who hankers after more_

**Stoic** is a Hugo theme derived from the [XMin theme](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin), and inspired by [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com) (previously known as the Academic theme), [Distill](https://distill.pub), and [Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism). See https://stoic.yihui.org for a live demo.

Please note that this project is still work-in-progress.
